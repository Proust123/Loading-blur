🔄 Loading Blur Animation
A smooth and visually appealing loading animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the percentage count increases from 0% to 100%, a blurred background image gradually 
becomes clear, simulating a loading effect.

✨ Features
Dynamic loading percentage displayed at the center.
Blurred background image that sharpens as loading progresses.
CSS animation fades out the loading text after completion.
Simple and clean design using vanilla JavaScript.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5
CSS3 (Keyframe Animation, Blur Filter)
JavaScript (Interval and DOM Manipulation)

🚀 How It Works
A setInterval() updates the loading percentage every 50ms.
The image blur is dynamically reduced from blur(100px) to blur(0px) as the percentage increases.
The text fades out using a CSS @keyframes animation once loading reaches 100%.
